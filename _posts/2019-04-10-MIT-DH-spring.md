I've benefited a lot from the wealth of resources that DH people put online, so in the collaborative spirit of the discipline, here are notes from most of the DH-related talks at MIT in spring 2019, along with a few editorial comments. **Click the title of the talk to go to the notes!**   
  

## **Digital history seminar** 

### [Digital History and the Spatial Turn](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uPV48YwpUtV2ZNpVlbEw-NoRO3HFUAHCvnjYjRFEpnc/edit?usp=sharing) 

Cameron Blevins (Northeastern)  
  
In a lot of ways, I thought this talk was a great way to get faculty members and students into the general contours of the conversations surrounding digital history – Cameron does a great job drawing distinctions between digital history, spatial history, and the spatial turn (even as he talks about not being particularly interested in defining what "digital humanities" or "digital history" really is). I thought the way that he made these distinctions was very clever: he pinpoints _public history_ and _mapping_ as the disciplinary roots of digital history, whereas he sees _literary studies_ as the intellectual progenitor for the digital humanities. (A really useful part of the talk for me was the incredible array of examples and citations he's been able to synthesize to give the audience a more synoptic view of where digital history and DH can go; see notes.)  
  
From there, Cameron introduces his own project, which uses exploratory visualizations to show how the narrative of settler colonialism plays out in the establishment of the US Postal Service in the 19th century. This particular talk was especially satisfying because Cameron showed us four different ways that his visualizations helped change the way that he thought about postal expansion. By mapping its size, coverage, rate of expansion, and by showing the postal system's relative instability, the maps show a different narrative of state power in the American West. How does the government literally transform the _space_ of the West to create a large and trenchant communication network? What's really compelling here is the fact that the visualizations don't just confirm what Cameron already knew, but that they form an exploratory form of analysis that is made possible by the mass availability of public facing datasets. He ends with an injunction for historians to think about datasets as we would archives – they're not neutral, but historically produced artifacts that can be read across the grain as we conduct exploratory data analysis.  
  

### [Energizing History with Digital Tools & Methods](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m-rnKyj9C-x5cm28if3s4gnFrc84JxcCBYJNZQEh5YE/edit?usp=sharing) 

Juliette Levy (UC Riverside)

  
Juliette introduced two of her digital pedagogy projects: [Digital Zombies](https://digitalzombies.ucr.edu/) and [Virtual Che](https://history.ucr.edu/news/2018/11/07/ches-village-virtual-reality-stimulate-critical-thinking), which are unconventional ways of teaching historical methods and analysis to large online survey classes. Since most of her classes have over a hundred students, it is difficult to actually lead students through analyzing a primary source (and, more tangibly, to do it in a way that is engaging). By using game-based learning (Digital Zombies) and virtual reality (Virtual Che), Juliette explores the boundaries of how digital tools might change historical pedagogy in a large state university.  
  

### [Computation and the Practice of 21st Century History](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dMEX2f_n6YdLQN-loTmhR0NDrgDuf8ddkOyPCD24J-Y/edit?usp=sharing)

Bill Turkel (University of Western Ontario)

  
Bill's work has always been really special to me, since I think the kind of "digital humanities" that he talks about are distinct from the kind of work that emphasizes cultural analytics or spatial analysis. By contrast, Bill has developed a [huge series of how-to guides](https://williamjturkel.net/how-to/) on how to conduct digital research, which puts a strong focus on born digital material, searchability, and information retrieval. In this talk, he talks about the ways the historical research can be automated so that your computer can be doing research 24/7 (even as you take walks outside to ponder your research). If his blog contains more concrete how-to guides about how to actually trap information and store it in a database, this talk gave a sort of theoretical overview of _why_ one might choose to do this while giving a solid explanation of how some of that technology works.

### [Doing DH from Start to Finish](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jo6IZu67Kpuer1-uT8nH0DtACFperhmQqD9jALvBfSU/edit?usp=sharing)

Scott Weingart (Carnegie Mellon)  
  
How many ways can I rave about this talk? Not only is Scott an incredible public speaker who speaks smoothly and extemporaneously, he structures his talks incredibly well: he gave an overview of three different kinds of DH project – complete with the kind of data work that needed to be done, as well as the methods he and his team used – and he gave a detailed schematic for the different ways to build and sustain a digital humanities community on a university campus. (You can also find his slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vR0FcOEi0fftU9fCLKiUX9ECf9nhtmDxnm2N6Ztlqb265wbOvLAPS_zzX1ymEwJ5v_doi4O5cu-PcT3/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000&slide=id.p).) How much more can you ask for in an hour?  
  

### [Beyond the Data Point: Ethics of Visualizing Migration](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JknWoJ7VLUrYLy7ybB0pVnj_5nCH0T-HtLnvf2JMouM/edit?usp=sharing)

Roopika Risam (Salem State)  
  
Roopika argues that maps and data visualizations which purport to be neutral are, in fact, political arguments. By disentangling the different ways that data are being flattened and simplified to create flashy visualizations, she argues that humanists need to really engage with visualizations – from interpreting to making them – in order to contextualize and humanize the way that migration is portrayed in existing graphics. Through the [Torn Apart/Separados](http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/torn-apart/volume/2/index) project, Roopika shows how maps of migration can be redrawn in order to show where Immigrant Detention Centers really are, and to show where the money comes from to fund this carceral infrastructure.

_Note:_ Unfortunately, I don't have notes for two talks -- Stephan Risi's "Querying the Infinite Archive: The Promise and Perils of Digital History" (Digital History Seminar) and Sarah Connell's "In Praise of the Unpredictable: Exploratory Research Methods for Digital Collections" (Digital Humanities Seminar).
