If we've talked about research methods for any extended amount of time, you've likely heard me talk at length about how to systematize the work that we do as academics: I usually evangelize about using [Zotero and Alfred](https://crystaljjlee.blogspot.com/search/label/research%20workflow) to curate one's reading. Or I might ramble on about my obsession with [DEVONThink](https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink), which is an incredibly powerful tool where I probably only use the tiniest fraction of its full horsepower (which I was introduced to by the great [Clare Kim](https://iph.wustl.edu/people/clare-kim)). That's certainly another (long overdue) blog post that I will write at some point, but I wanted to talk more today about my latest obsession: [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten). 

On its face, there is a lot to like: the method promises a great deal of academic productivity (it worked for Luhmann!), as the atomicity of each note helps you inch slowly towards writing something large, rather than avoiding writing altogether and then trying to pull it together at the last minute (oof, me). More than that, though, it fits my penchant for keeping notes and self-tracking: there's something about the personal archiving and the _systematization_ of knowledge that makes the STS person in me really sing. What better way to think about the politics and implications of classification than to do it yourself? 

On the flip side, though, endless focus on the systems of productivity can often come at the expense of...actually doing the work. In the words of a prolific philosopher friend: it's easy to become intoxicated by the _promise_ of productivity with just a better note-taking or scheduling system, as it becomes the site of productive procrastination. I am skeptical too of the productivity gurus who seem hellbent on showing you _how_ to be productive without necessarily having other work to show for it (save guides on productivity). There's a relentless push towards efficiency and the optimization of knowledge work that makes me deeply uncomfortable, though I recognize that they are often the very things that entice me towards these things in the first place. 

As someone who struggles to write all at once, though (except email and Twitter threads,  oddly), I'm excited by the idea of incremental daily writing. There are different flavors of this daily writing practice; morning pages can be used both creatively and for personal introspection. But with Zettelkasten, the purpose of each card is to simply note _a single idea_ and link them to others such that when the time comes, you already have a lot of writing done. 

I'm kind of surprised that there aren't more anthropologists who use this method: it seems like a great way to tag all field notes into atomized ideas that you can then connect to other instances. Many field notes are dated entries anyways (depending on your personal system; see more about this in _[Writing Ethnographic Fieldnotes](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/W/bo12182616.html),_ which I highly recommend), and chunking up these different components seems like a great way to dig deep into ethnographic data. I am surprised too that so much of this literature is written by software engineers and computer scientists -- Luhmann was a sociologist! Many of the videos on YouTube that walk you through the Zettelkasten method using systems like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) \-- my current choice -- are about programming, but there is a [fantastic video walk-through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txsScSC53-8&ab_channel=KeepProductive) from [Courtney Applewhite](https://www.religion.ucsb.edu/people/student/courtney-applewhite/) where she talks through her process using the Zettelkasten method for her religious studies PhD qualifying exam. I wish I knew about this when I was studying for my own exams! 

My main project right now is to take many of my _fleeting notes_ -- what Sönke Ahren describes as things that are shorthand for larger ideas that you might write during meetings -- and turn them into _permanent_ or _evergreen notes_. \[1\] I tend to take notes during my meetings and at seminars, but I often don't look back or reference them at all, which often renders the act of note-taking useless. I have tried to rectify this in part by making all the [notes I take during seminars](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11UP2DG0tbb8KwMe1V9thxey0iIVP3sO2HYZcbFEsGIo/edit) public, which has (1) made me more accountable to taking good notes, (2) ensures that I actually pay attention and process what the speaker is talking about, and (3) has, from what I can tell, been a good resources for people who wanted to see the talk but couldn't make it. At this point, I really do enjoy the act of note-taking (in part because I feel extremely competent at it), and I'd like to transfer a lot of these skills towards _actually writing_ (where I feel extremely incompetent). 

Despite my previous ranting about humanists and social scientists not being active in this note-taking / personal knowledge management space, upon further reflection, there are actually quite a few who have been really helpful for shaping my research workflow! (I've mentioned Alex Strick and Rachel Leow in the past. I also take inspiration from Andy Matuschak (link to [his notebook](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z7kEFe6NfUSgtaDuUjST1oczKKzQQeQWk4Dbc)), Cosma Shalizi ([notes](http://bactra.org/notebooks/)), and the person who started this craze for me in the first place, [Geoffrey Litt](https://www.geoffreylitt.com/). Geoffrey has written a great piece on using [Twitter threads for idea sketching](https://www.geoffreylitt.com/2020/09/21/twitter-and-media-for-sketching.html), which I've also been trying to use to cure my writer's block. I think the bite sized nature of Twitter and email makes the process of writing much less daunting, which I hope Zettelkasten can do.  

I didn't know it at the time, but I was first introduced to Zettelkasten when I first took Tom Mullaney's archival methods seminar at Stanford: I remember he actually owned a huge chest of drawers much like Luhmann did, and he further [systematizes his database search terms](https://youtu.be/mfRDqQL7PP4). Nick Seaver, an anthropologist of algorithms, also uses Obsidian for Zettelkasten and is experimenting with the [Johnny.Decimal](https://johnnydecimal.com/) system. Kevin Baker, historian of computing, uses Roam. I can't find it right now, but Jeffrey Moro used to write public notes and has a fantastic post on his [writing workflow](https://jeffreymoro.com/blog/2020-09-21-how-i-write/). 

In terms of the greatest resources of all time, though, I can't recommend guides from three historians: William Turkel's "[How To](https://williamjturkel.net/how-to/)" series, Robert A. Carl's YouTube series "[Research/Craft](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLInjTK7TLuVftmQALN80fAfAsEGTh5LFg)," and Emily A. Prifogle's masterful [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/EmilyAPrifogle/status/1093516265833025537?s=20) on her research and writing process. 

The important thing in all of this — beyond the systems — is consistency. Like exercise, it isn't necessarily the _type_ of workout that you do (though some are better for you than others!), but that you are able to do it regularly. Anyways, lots more to say about this, but this is some of the planning I've been doing in the last couple days before the semester starts up again. Eek! 

\[1\] Ahren also has a longer [Quora post](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-way-to-take-notes/answer/S%C3%B6nke-Ahrens?ch=10&share=e1efd8f9&srid=uJBsW) (and a book!) that aptly taxonomizes the different forms of notetaking, and on how the Zettelkasten system works.
