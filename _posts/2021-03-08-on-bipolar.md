I recently read David Chang's _Eat A Peach_, a memoir where he puzzles at the strange turns he's taken to go from mediocre line cook to a Michelin starred chef and restauranteur. Some might read it as an ode to food and cooking Ã  la Anthony Bourdain, others as a heavily caveated guide on what it's like to open a restaurant in New York City. For me, it is a reflection on what it's like to live and work with bipolar disorder, where depression can often manifest as an obsessive desire to work and not just sitting in the doldrums, and mania a delicious high where everything is tinted in saturated technicolor and things could move just a *little* bit faster. I feel this sense of familiarity almost every time I see some public portrait of bipolar disorder, whether it's the OG (Kay Redfield Jamison's *An Unquiet Mind*) or other artistic depictions (Anne Hathaway in _Modern Love_ or Ellen Forney's graphic novel _Marbles_).
