If my computer were ever to completely crash and I'd have to install everything over again, [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) and [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) (with the PowerPack) are at the top of the list. It's not that I think Zotero and Alfred are definitively the best tools for the job – my partner, for example, swears by [EndNote](https://endnote.com/), and my friends who are die-hard LaTeX holdouts exclusively use [BibTeX](http://www.bibtex.org/). In fact, I used to religiously use [Papers](http://www.bibtex.org/), but I found inserting the citations to be really buggy, and I didn't find the same community who would develop a constellation of useful add-ons to improve the general research experience. (I used to hold out for annotation extraction, but ever since I found [ZotFile](http://zotfile.com/), whatever hold Papers had on me disappeared.)  
  
But seriously, as I've tried to figure out my own digital research workflow – inspired in no small part by Bill Turkel's [essential guide](https://williamjturkel.net/how-to/) to doing digital research and Miriam Posner's [guide to research management assets](http://miriamposner.com/blog/embarrassments-of-riches-managing-research-assets/) – I thought I'd share some of the Zotero and Alfred add-ons that have generally made my life easier. Zotero has been so useful for managing a storm of PDFs as I'm reading for my oral exams, and the Alfred workflows have made a lot of little actions – like checking all the things I have on my calendar or navigating through my files – into things I can complete in a couple of keystrokes. (I revel in ways to use my laptop exclusively through the keyboard, which is made easier by Chrome extensions like [DeadMouse](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/deadmouse/kioijmpindokaaahaeigkkkbogccljhm).) I know that it's not super likely that I'm _actually_ saving all that much time by trimming off a couple seconds here and there, but it really helps me get into the flow of doing research and generally having my digital interactions match an easily excitable brain.  
  
So, without further adieu ––  
  

## Zotero add-ons 

  

I've written about [how I organize PDFs in Zotero](https://crystaljjlee.blogspot.com/2019/03/organizing-pdfs-for-research.html) before, but here's a more complete list:

-   [ZotFile](http://zotfile.com/) – extract PDF annotations, automatically rename/move/attach PDFs to Zotero items, sync PDFs from Zotero library to your (mobile) PDF reader, extract annotations from PDF files
-   [Storage Scanner](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-storage-scanner) – find orphan attachments/citations
-   [Report Customizer](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-report-customizer) – customize display fields in Zotero reports, similar to [Jason Priem's Report Cleaner](http://jasonpriem.org/projects/report_cleaner.php)
-   [Auto Indexer](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-auto-index) – automatically keeps attachments indexed 
-   [Zutilo](https://github.com/willsALMANJ/Zutilo) – batch editing of Zotero library items 

  

## Alfred workflows 

  

I would recommend looking through Dave Wikoff's "[Curated List of Awesome Alfred Workflows](https://github.com/derimagia/awesome-alfred-workflows)," as well as all of the workflows produced by Github users [vitorgalvao](https://github.com/vitorgalvao/alfred-workflows/) and [ctwise](https://github.com/ctwise/alfred-workflows). You could also get really lost in [Awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome#entertainment), which is a foundry of great resources – there are curated lists of resources related to specific subjects (machine vision, economics, food, mental health, etc.), interesting email newsletters, open source documents, and beyond.
