**(Slide 1: Title slide)** Hi! In my talk today, I'll share some of the core ideas about my mission to design meaningful multi-sensory experiences, where data visualization experts and cartographers alike can design experiences that take disability more broadly into account. I'll say up front that I don't have answers *yet* about how to mobilize this into practice – this will be the result of my PhD! – but embarking on this has led me to critically examine efforts to do this in the past and present, which give me a way to frame designing and evaluating these kinds of technologies. 

**(Slide 2)** By way of background, I'm a researcher in science and technology studies who uses insights from disability studies to make and interrogate data visualizations. 

**(Slide 3)** But before I get to that more concretely, I want to frame my talk with a concept from human-computer interaction theory: "beyond being there," and I'll illustrate it by talking about a technology we're all familiar with: **Zoom.** 

**(Slide 4)** Before you tune out completely, I'll say that it's a great example about the inherent tensions at the juncture of design and disability, and I want to use this example as a way to think about resolving them.

I think it's safe to say that we've all heard some version of these arguments as it relates to access: **(Slide 4, animation 1)** **first**, the pandemic has given people the opportunity to attend to professional opportunities that wouldn't otherwise be possible. As an example, it might be a *physically proximate* situation where people might not have been able to physically attend bc of chronic pain or lack of transportation, or it might be a *physically distant* situation that might have been too financially onerous (eg, attending a conference much like this one).

**(Slide 4, animation 2)** **Secondly**, and perhaps more importantly, the outsized reliance on Zoom has thrown existing social inequalities into sharper relief, and often exacerbated them, especially when it comes to digital infrastructure and economic conditions. When it comes to issues like digital infrastructure and economic conditions, we've seen how the pandemic disproportionately devastates families who might not have the internet bandwidth or the equipment to support remote schooling, or they might have caretaking and financial responsibilities that make surviving the pandemic near-impossible.

**(Slide 5)** Throughout all of this, as we feel an overwhelming, collective sense of fatigue, and often the common refrain is "I can't wait for the After Times, when we don't have to Zoom anymore." To be clear, I relate to this deeply.

**(Slide 6)** Others have suggested (more eloquently than me) that we are partly tired by the screen time, but it's really capitalism – the lack of a meaningful social safety net, exploitation of vulnerable workers – that's the root of this fatigue. **This is a structural problem.** 

## Video chat as a design problem

**(Slide 7)** **So let's attend to this as a design problem:** how can we think about designing a future that allows us to capitalize on the strides in access *while acknowledging and mitigating* the harms of using this technology? Zoom, as we've seen, is not a panacea and has a range of accessibility problems; there also a  myriad of security, privacy, and moderation issues that abound on this platform.

**(Slide 8)** Just yesterday, a virtual reading with the legendary cyborg Jillian Weise was zoom bombed, and Liz Jackson writes on Twitter about the eventual fallout, where she shows a black screen where the "chat becomes disabled." 

**(Slide 9)** So let's come back to "Beyond Being There." If the point is to *imitate* face-to-face interaction, then this design is set up for failure. If people use these technologies (e.g. 3D holograms) but still use prioritize face-to-face interactions to those who are physically proximate to them, then there will always be a problem.

**(Slide 10)** In their own words: 

>  What we are getting at is this: telecommunications research seems to work under the implicit assumption that there is a natural and perfect state – being there – and that our state is in some sense broken when we are not physically proximate.

This is the ableism of, say, academic participation policies, as if *physical presence,* rather than engagement, is a marker for participation. Circumventing this requires us to think about a new medium where we focus on the kind of communication we would use *even if face-to-face interaction were possible*. The examples they give (this being the 90s) looks very similar to the world we have today: email, asynchronous social media services, community chat boards, etc.

This is not to say that all forms of imitation or emulation are bad, or that we shouldn't do them. This is more to emphasize the fact that our barometer for what makes them successful should *not* be replicating "the real thing" – a concept that often assumes ablebodiedness, or a status quo that is already violent – but about radically re-imagining a new way to think, be, and interact. In other words, instead of romanticizing the Before Times, let's work together to fundamentally re-imagine not just the technologies, but the social ecologies in which they are embedded. 

## Over and under-promising in design

**(Slide 11)** I'm reminded here of some wisdom from a friend of mine about how technology can simultaneously *over* and *underpromise* . Simplistically, designing inclusive tech that overpromises can often be a way of re-entrenching techno-ableism. 

**(Slide 12)** What is technoableism?

> “Technoableism…describes a rhetoric of disability that at once talks about empowering disabled people through technologies while at the same time reinforcing ableist tropes about what body-minds are good to have and what counts as worthy.”

Famous examples of this include cochlear implants or exoskeletons (e.g. "wheelchairs that can climb stairs!").

**(Slide 13)** If we're talking about over-optimistic – and frankly dangerous – forms of this kind of design, we're really talking about how some inventions are trying to "eradicate disability" or to force disabled bodies to fit into ableist norms. There is nothing inclusive or anti-ableist about designing something that simply makes oppression more efficient or actively hides it. 

This design paradigm is therefore *under-ambitious* insofar as in trying to make optimize status quo, there is no deeper engagement on changing the social world in which these technologies live. The intense focus on replicating *being there* undercuts the substantial contributions designers can make, and limits the affordances of new technologies. Paired with the technoableism of trying to optimize the status quo – one that is already violent – this is a design paradigm that we should not aspire to reproduce. 

To conclude this first part, I want to argue that reflecting on these dynamics can be a source of ethical practice: we don't want to idealize an anterior or a present condition. How do we embrace a new paradigm of interaction entirely? How do we critically think about the *function* of these designs without reproducing the injustice? 

**(Slide 14)** Aimi Hamraie and Kelly Fritsch have one answer: embracing **crip technoscience.** Echoing the other panelists today, Hamraie and Fritsch argue that: 

> “…while technology can be deployed for unwanted cures or enhancements, it can also be reclaimed, hacked, and tinkered with to create a more accessible world. By centering crip theory and politics, we hold space for what \[Alison\] Kafer calls ‘ambivalent relationships to technology.’”

## Accessible visualizations in practice 

**(Slide 15)** From here, I want to give a few examples of how this manifests with data visualization and mapmaking. 

**(Slide 16)** I'll describe three major themes: 
1. The woes of 1:1 translation 
2. Be transparent, minimal, and straightforward 
3. Competing accommodations 

### Woes of 1:1 translation 
**(Slide 17)** Here, I'll show a failed attempt on my part to create a system of easily generating 3D visualizations. My collaborators and I were interested in seeing if we could generate these on the fly, since educators at the Perkins School for the Blind (with whom we had collaborated) were making each of the visualizations as they needed them in class.

**(Slide 18)** As an example, we drew on the "Tactual Map of MIT," which was developed as part of a collaboration between Perkins and MIT, and this is a picture of an unrolled vinyl map on a table with raised etchings. 

**(Slide 19)** This is a picture of the textured legend: water, sidewalks, fences, roads, buildings, etc. are all rendered as different kinds of dots, lines, and geometric symbols. 

**(Slide 20)** The problem with these maps is that they assume that sighted and tactile learners absorb information in the same way. As Lucia Hasty writes, 

> **Sighted learners** learn new information in what's called "**whole to part**." They see the whole picture simultaneously, and are able to tell where that fits in relation to other objects around it; for instance, size, distance, that kind of thing.

**(Slide 21)** 

> **Tactile learners** learn in exactly the opposite direction. They learn **part to whole.** They get the information from what they're looking at — for instance, a tactile graphic — with whatever they're seeing at that moment. What you touch is what you see. And they have to put all of the little pieces of information together in a sequence to come up with a whole picture.

### Be transparent, minimal, and straightforward 
**(Slide 22)** So let's talk about being transparent, minimal, and straightforward.

**(Slide 23)** Drawing on best practices from historical braille transcription and tactile graphics, many of the tools used in making tactile visualizations is very much *not* flashy data scrollytelling, but  bespoke, artisanal work. To this end, a great deal of my research is thinking not just about computing and interactivity, but about the limitations of fabrication. How can we work both in preserving and extending best practices about embossing and braille specifications, particularly with minimal tools?

**(Slide 24)** How can we reduce visual or tactile clutter and use texture and shapes judiciously? My collaborator, Alan, is thinking a lot about the affordances of NLP and its ability to create clear, concise text summaries, and there have been projects like **(Slide 25)** "Alt Text as Poetry" that teaches people how to implement this in practice.

### Competing accomodations
**(Slide 26)** Of course, there are also competing accommodations -- universal design is impossible and often undesirable. 

**(Slide 27)** **Data sonification** can be inaccessible for Deaf people. **Haptic interfaces** are largely inaccessible in Plague Season, and can be inaccessible for people with touch sensitivities, or (in cases where braille is present), for those who do not read braille. **Olfactory approaches** are impossible for those with fragrance sensitivity (and frankly, I have found them to be mostly gimmicky and mostly do the kind of 1:1 translation I described earlier). So where does this leave us? I want to show some examples, though, of data sonification that I find compelling, and which can improve the experience of a visualization, particularly for individuals with ADHD to emphasize audibly what they see visually. 

![screenshot of two projects from Brian Foo: "Air Play: Smog Music created with Beijing Air Quality Data," which includes a visualization of multiple dots showing that the air is hazardous; "Two Trains: Sonification of Income Inequality on the NYC Subway," which shows a train line from Brooklyn coming up to New York as a red line](/img/8-data-driven-dj.png)

**(Slide 28)** For example, "Data Driven DJ" Brian Foo, a sound artist, has created semi-orchestral pieces that sonify Beijing air quality data or income inequality, where each piece manipulates noise to highlight peaks and valleys. 

**(Slide 29)** You can see a similar dynamic with Carni Klir's sonification of the *NYT* COVID death chart, where he punctuates time and adds noise as the deaths pile up. 

**(Slide 30)** I will acknowledge that a great deal of what I've said is ultimately unsatisfying, and that what I've provided is mostly a template for speculative futures that all hinge upon the phrase "it depends." However, what I hope you can take away from this is a framework and a call to action: to think *beyond* being there, and to join me in re-imagining both the technologies we design and the social worlds that we inhabit together.
